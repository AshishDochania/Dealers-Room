1. Role-Based Routing & Dashboard Separation
Challenge:
Implementing different dashboard experiences for buyers and sellers using React Router based on user roles.

Solution:
We built a PrivateRoute component that checks the authenticated user's role and conditionally renders either the Buyer or Seller dashboard after login. This provided a clean, role-specific experience.

2. Real-Time Chat Integration
Challenge:
Maintaining consistent real-time messaging between buyers and sellers, including joining and leaving rooms and syncing new messages across clients.

Solution:
We used socket.io with room-based architecture, emitting and listening to messages in real-time based on dealId. We also used refetch() on message reception to sync the latest chat on both sides.

3. File Uploads with Cloudinary
Challenge:
Uploading and managing deal-specific files with secure backend integration, while avoiding large local storage.

Solution:
Used multer for handling multipart form data and uploaded files directly to Cloudinary. We then saved Cloudinary file URLs in MongoDB for efficient access.

4. Redis Integration for Optimization
Challenge:
Integrating Redis in a scalable way to cache frequent operations and avoid unnecessary database hits.

Solution:
We modularized Redis configuration and replaced direct Redis instantiation with a central config file. Redis was used in middlewares and controllers to cache deal and user data efficiently.

5. Deployment Issues (Render & Netlify)
Challenge:

Backend Redis TLS errors during deployment on Render

404 errors on frontend route refresh (e.g. /dashboard)

MongoDB connection failures due to IP whitelist

Solution:

Adjusted Redis config to work without TLS in production

Handled route fallback using _redirects file on Netlify

Allowed all IPs temporarily in MongoDB Atlas for smooth deployment
